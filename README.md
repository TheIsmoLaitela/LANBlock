Software for LAN Parties. Suggest and vote games!

Project uses PHP and JavaScript.

The idea is to create small, but helpful program to help management of LAN parties. Currently only available feature is list of games, possibility to add them, edit details and vote games. With this information players know which games to download/buy/install before the big event. In the end, LAN is about to be in LAN, not in Internet. If there happens to be internet, there is a high change it's not that great.

Every other idea you come along, please feel free to do download and edit this program as you wish!
